DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS
  
  Introduction to Window object and Document object:

    Window object:  
      window objects is the TOP-MOST-OBJECT in the (BOM) browser object model. window object is actually a window 
      or tab or an iframes. it represent single tab, which contains browser history, location and the device screen
      In my point of view it is actually what we see in the tab that appear while loading web page.

    Document object:
      Document object is actually the HTML document. It represent the whole HTML document as a tree of (HTML, HEAD,
      BODY and other HTML tags).it is any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web 
      page's content, which is the DOM tree.

    WINDOW OBJECT VERSUS DOCUMENT OBJECT:

    Window object:
     1)It is top most object and outermost element of the javascript object hierarchy.  
     2)The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document.
     3)it contains DOCUMENT, browser history, location, the device screen, navigator and frames[].
     4)It can be accessed by window.Propertyname and window.Method ().
     5)window.open() opens a new tab or window.  

    Document object:
     1)Document object is one of the element in the window object hierarchy.
     2)Document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
     3)It contains anchor[], applet[], area[], embeds[], form[], image[], layer[], links[].
     4)it cane accessed by document.Propertyname and document.Method (). access a document object either 
       using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object.
     5)Document.open() creates a blank document within the window. This shows that document oject is contain 
       within the window object.
